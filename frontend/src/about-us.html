    <p>
        Welcome to the UMass Amherst Student Farmer’s Market! Organized by UMass Permaculture and UMass Students Farms, 
        the UMass Farmer’s Market give UMass students and faculty alike a place to find handmade goods, freshly grown 
        produce, medicinal herbs, and even live music. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The goal of this website is to provide you with all relevant information surrounding the market: when it will take 
        place, what vendors are going to be there, and what products you can find. We work closely with participating students 
        to display accurate and updated information that you can use to determine who will be there and what you might like 
        to purchase. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
        You can find the different goods you can buy on the products page and see who is going to be there on our vendors page. 
        You can even create an account to save favorited products and vendors, using the My Account page.
    </p>
