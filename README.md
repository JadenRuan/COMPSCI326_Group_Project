# COMPSCI326 Group Project

Project Title: Farmerâ€™s Market Map

Team Number: Team 24

Problem Description: There is not a lot of information available about student vendors at the UMass Students' farmers market. Students can't easily find out when the farmer's market is, where it is located, or who will be vending. Vendors also can't update products they will be selling and thus cannot reach their audience (the student consumers) as well as they would like to.  

Solution: We want to create a platform that contains relevant information about the student vendors at the farmers market and the current foot traffic at any given time. This will allow people to be better informed about the market on a specific day and have it also be more accessible and convenient to both the attendees and the vendors at the market.


Key Features:
- Subtabs for vendors to describe their products and availability. This will allow vendors to promote their products and allow students to be informed about what products they can purchase.
