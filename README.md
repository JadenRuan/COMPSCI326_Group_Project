# COMPSCI326 Group Project

Project Title: Farmerâ€™s Market Map

Team Number: Team 24

Problem Description: There is not a lot of information available about student vendors at the UMass Students farmers market. Students can't easily find out when the farmer's market is, where it is located, or who will be vending. Vendors also can't update products they will be selling and thus cannot reach their audience (the student consumers) as well as they would like to.
